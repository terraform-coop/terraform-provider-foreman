}
```


## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `bmc_success` - (Optional) Tracks the partial state of BMC operations on host creation. If these operations fail, the host will be created in Foreman and this boolean will remain `false`. On the next `terraform apply` will trigger the host update to pick back up with the BMC operations.
- `comment` - (Optional) Add additional information about this host.Note: Changes to this attribute will trigger a host rebuild.
- `compute_attributes` - (Optional) Hypervisor specific VM options. Must be a JSON string, as every compute provider has different attributes schema
- `compute_profile_id` - (Optional) 
- `compute_resource_id` - (Optional, Force New) 
- `domain_id` - (Optional, Force New) ID of the domain to assign to the host.
- `enable_bmc` - (Optional) Enables PMI/BMC functionality. On create and update calls, having this enabled will force a host to poweroff, set next boot to PXE and power on. Defaults to `false`.
- `environment_id` - (Optional) ID of the environment to assign to the host.
- `hostgroup_id` - (Optional, Force New) ID of the hostgroup to assign to the host.
- `image_id` - (Optional, Force New) ID of an image to be used as base for this host when cloning
- `interfaces_attributes` - (Optional) Host interface information.
- `manage_build` - (Optional) Create host only, don't set build status or manage power states
- `medium_id` - (Optional, Force New) ID of the medium mounted on the host.
- `method` - (Optional, Force New) Chooses a method with which to provision the HostOptions are "build" and "image"
- `model_id` - (Optional) ID of the hardware model if applicable
- `name` - (Required, Force New) Host fully qualified domain name.
- `operatingsystem_id` - (Optional, Force New) ID of the operating system to put on the host.
- `owner_id` - (Optional) ID of the user or usergroup that owns the host.
- `owner_type` - (Optional) Owner of the host, must be either User ot Usergroup
- `parameters` - (Optional) A map of parameters that will be saved as host parameters in the machine config.
- `puppet_class_ids` - (Optional) IDs of the applied puppet classes.
