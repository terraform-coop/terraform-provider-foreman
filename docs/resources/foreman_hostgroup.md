# foreman_hostgroup


Hostgroups are organized in a tree-like structure and inherit values from their parent hostgroup(s). When hosts get associated with a hostgroup, it will inherit attributes from the hostgroup. This allows for easy, shared configuration of various hosts based on common attributes.


## Example Usage

```
# Autogenerated example with required keys
resource "foreman_hostgroup" "example" {
  name = "compute"
}
```
